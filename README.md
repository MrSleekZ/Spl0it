Hello and welcome to Spl0it!
---------------------------------------------
FAQ:
1. (What is Spl0it?)
* Spl0it is a program by MrSleekZ and Levi_Mcc!
* Spl0it is designed to slowly crash the targeted machine using up all the CPU and RAM usage to its max.

2. (How does it crash the machine?)
First, Spl0it kills explorer.exe and then runs the payloads.
There are currently 45 payloads ranging from RAM and CPU eaters.
Spl0it loops the payloads until the machine crashes.

3. (How do I stop it?)
The trouble with Spl0it is that once it fully executes, it takes up almost all the CPU and RAM usage for the machine it is targeted to, making it very hard to stop it. Try the points below:
1. If you have software that can block folder access, add Spl0it to it.
2. If you the program is executed, try stopping the main payload before it creates more

4. (Is it malware?)
No, Spl0it uses a batch and VBS file to run the program and the payloads. However, in Spl0it BigB0i, CD.vbs and Keyboard.vbs may be detected as malware, it is a false postive.

5. (What is the difference between Spl0it and Spl0it Anonymous)
The difference the Spl0it and Spl0it Anonymous is that the normal Spl0it doesn't contain any files that are considered malware by Anti-virus software. Please read point 3 for more information.

6. (Where are the files stored?)
The files are stored anywhere that the attacker chooses. 
If the attacker is using it for malicious intentions, it will most likely be in the system or user's startup folder. Read point 6 for more information.

7. (Where is the StartUp folder?)
There are two startup folders.
1. The system's - Click the windows key + R, type 'shell: startup common' to get to the system's Startup folder. (ADMIN REQUIRED!).
2. The users - Click the windows key + R, type 'shell: startup' to get to the user's Startup folder.
